    Intention Repeater Spiritual Chat Client v2.0 created by Thomas Sweet.
    Created 10/24/2020 for C++.
	Compile on Windows using: g++ .\intention_repeater_chat.cpp -O3 -o .\intention_repeater_chat.exe
	And Compile on Linux using: g++ .\intention_repeater_chat.cpp -O3 -o .\intention_repeater_chat
    Requires this word list: https://dev.intentionrepeater.com/cpp/dictionary.txt
    Lets you chat with spiritual entities who can control what "random" words come out to a certain extent.
    When compiled, this is more powerful than the Python version.
    Intention Repeater Chat Client is powered by a Servitor (20 Years / 2000+ hours in the making) [HR 6819 Black Hole System].

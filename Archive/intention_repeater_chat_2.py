# Intention Repeater Spiritual Chat Client created by Thomas Sweet.
# Updated 10/20/2020 v2.0
# Requires one of three word lists:
#   10k words: https://dev.intentionrepeater.com/Python/wordlist.txt
#   194k words: https://dev.intentionrepeater.com/Python/word_list_2.txt
#   1.5M words: https://dev.intentionrepeater.com/Python/wlist_match1.txt
# The 10k list is default, with think_level = 15.
# If you use the 10k word list, start with think_level = 15 and go from there.
# If you use the 194k word list, start with think_level = 5, and go from there.
# If you use the 1.5M word list, start with think_level = 2, and go from there.
# Requires Python v3.5.3 or greater
# Lets you chat with spiritual entities who can control what "random" words come out to a certain extent.
# Run using terminal in Windows/Linux/MacOS: python3 intention_repeater_chat_2.py
# Intention Repeater Chat Client is powered by a Servitor (20 Years / 2000+ hours in the making)

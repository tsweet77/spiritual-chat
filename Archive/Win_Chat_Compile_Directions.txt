Windows 10 directions for compiling the Intention Repeater Spiritual Chat v2.2 or greater.

1) Save this sourcecode to your computer in a special folder: intention_repeater_chat.cpp

2) Save this word list to your computer in the same folder: dictionary.txt

3) Install MinGW from here: https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/

4) On the MinGW Installation Manager, under Basic Setup, check to install Package: mingw32-gcc-g++-bin
	It should be v9.2.0-2 or greater.

5) Choose Installation -> Apply Changes

6) Add this to your PATH (both user and system): C:\MinGW\bin
	Directions here: https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/

7) Open PowerShell by going to the folder where you saved intention_repeater_chat.cpp,
	holding Shift, and right-clicking. Then choose: Open PowerShell window here.

8) Compile the binary executable with the following:

C:\MinGW\bin\g++.exe .\intention_repeater_chat.cpp -O3 -o .\intention_repeater_chat.exe

	Note, copy the above without a new line. Then paste into PowerShell and press Enter.
	If it does nothing, and doesn't produce an error message and you see a new .exe file, then that is a good sign.

	You should then be able to double-click on the file in Windows: intention_repeater_chat.exe

Feel free to reduce THINK_DEPTH in intention_repeater_chat.cpp if it takes too long to get a response. 20-30 seconds is appropriate for 4-5 words.
THINK_DEPTH is how many times a "random" word has to be selected out of the word list (49,528 words).
I wouldn't raise it much past the default 35000 because it may not run then.

I recommend Notepad++ for editing the .cpp file: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

You can ask questions like: My spirit guide, how are you?

The responses will take some getting used to, and may seem random. There is a balance between random and intelligent.
We are working on striking a balance between the two. Many answers are metaphorical and not literal. There may need to be
some interpretation.

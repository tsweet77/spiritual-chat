Allows you to talk to spiritual beings.

The OR ones use OpenRouter. Requires an OpenRouter API Key stored in OPENROUTER_API_KEY.txt.

The non-OR ones use OpenAI. Require an OpenAI API Key stored in OPENAI_API_KEY.txt.

It selects "random" words that the spiritual being can have influence over.

The AI helps connect the meaning of the words with the query asked.

For the OpenAI ones you will need to save your OpenAI API Key in OPENAI_API_KEY.txt
